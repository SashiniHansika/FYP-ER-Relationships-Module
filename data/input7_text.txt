A small racing league want a database to keep track of teams, drivers, races and scores in the league.
The league is run for teams, which are identified by their names.
Each team has one or more drivers signed up, and each driver is registered with the league and has a unique league licence number.
First and last names of the drivers should also be included.
A driver may only participate for a single team throughout the season.
Races are identified simply by the dates when they are run. For each race, the league also wants to store the venue where it took place.
Drivers participate in races, and for each participating driver the database should store the total race time for that driver, and the league score they got from that race.
